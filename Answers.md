1. What are the order of insertions/removals for the following data structures?
   - **Stack** Last in first out. Items are added to the top and are also the first to be removed.
   - **Queue** First in first out. Items are added to the back, but the very first item is the first to be removed.
2. What is the retreival time complexity for the following data structures?
   - **Linked List** O(1)
   - **Hash Table** O(n)
   - **Binary Search Trees** O(n)
2. What are some advantages to using a Hash Tables over an array in JavaScript?
Hash tables keep order vs arrays where if you use a for-loop, there is no garuntee that items will be returned in the same order. With hash tables, it's much easier to retrieve data because the key and value are stored. With arrays, one would possibly have to loop through many items to find what they're looking for and the code to do so is longer.
